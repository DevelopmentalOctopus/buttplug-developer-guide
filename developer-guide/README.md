The Developers Guide Repo is [available on
github](https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-developers-guide).

We recommend checking out the [Buttplug Protocol
Spec](https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug) ([Repo on
Github](https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug)) before diving into
the Developer's Guide. The Protocol Spec details our low level
messaging protocol, which this guide builds on.
