# Introduction

In this section, we'll cover Buttplug's core protocol and architectures. Getting a hang of the definitions and contexts here is important, as these terms will be used throughout the rest of this guide, as well as in identifiers (variable/method names, etc) in Buttplug itself.

None of this chapter is programming language specific. While how these structures are implemented in different programming languages may differ, the general idea will be the same across most systems. Any stark differences should be called out in documentation for the specific implementations.

All of the information in this section is also in the [Buttplug Protocol Specification Introduction](https://buttplug-spec.docs.buttplug.io), albeit in a somewhat less friendly format, more up-front format. If you like stuff explained in standard-ese, definitely check that out. This section will basically be a recap of that info in a more informal fashion.
